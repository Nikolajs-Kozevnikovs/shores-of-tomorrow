# Some notes for the development
ideas that might help.

### Storing data
It would be a good idea to have a separate function called createNPCs() that would create all NPCs and link them to rooms
Same thing createQuests() for quests, create and then link them together.


### IMPORTANT
If we have a map predefined, then there is no reason to make an image out of it. It would be way more eficient to build it from Rooms array (Room.cs)

# Wishlist

- PNGs for NPC faces
- check if screen is the right size all the time, not just before the game starts
- Starting screen with suggestions (don't scroll up, etc.)
