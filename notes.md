# Some notes for the development
ideas that might help.

### Rooms

Right now rooms work on a relational basis (they are all connected one to another as links), which might be suboptimal depending on the size of our map

### Quests

For now, there is a basic algorithm for tracking progress (just number out of number), I need to get some quest ideas to see if more complicated logic is required.

### Storing data

At this moment, we have no idea how to store the data in our game (image maps, NPCs, etc.)
